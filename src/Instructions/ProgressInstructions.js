      Thank you for trusting KidsLearn to help the development of your little
      one. <br />
      Below are some suggestions on how to best utilize the platform. As well as
      an explanation of the scoring system. All the activities except for Doodle
      consist of display and control sections, you are meant to direct your
      childs attention to the display while using the control to change the
      content on screen.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <h5>LETTERS</h5>
      <p>
        It may be most effective to start with single letters and move onto
        words and eventually phrases or sentences as your child progresses.
      </p>
      <h5>SHAPES</h5>
      <p>
        We suggest starting the shapes section with colors, later move onto
        shape names & finally both the color and shape.
      </p>
      <h5>OBJECTS</h5>
      <p>
        It may be benificial to first allow your child to identify the object
        icons you choose to display by click, and then move onto any activity
        that may be associated with it.
      </p>
      <h5>ANIMALS</h5>
      <p>
        After your child can identify each or most of the animals you could have
        them associate the colors, sounds or habitats of said animal.
      </p>
      <h5>CLOTHES</h5>
      <p>
        Clothing is an automatically graded and reported activity. It shows a
        list of illustrations of items of clothing and the answer is meant to be
        its corresponding part of the body. Its graded automatically after
        clicking the button in the control section. This can be interpreted
        differently so if you feel you have an answer that is not scored
        correctly, please contact us using the email/letter icons at the bototm
        of the page.
      </p>
      <h5>DOODLE</h5>
      <p>
        Doodle is a non graded activity. It is meant to teach your child how to
        work with the mouse/trackpad. You can take it a step further and have
        them identify the colors but the hope is to allow them to interact with
        the page themselves. Which could lead to them quizzing themselves or
        others.

      <h3>Scoring</h3>
      Our scoring system depends on the parent. We trust you to challenge your
      child to provide a satisfactory answer for anything displayed and mark it
      accordingly. Our system works off a maximum score of 20 correct answers as
      we feel that is an effective amount of time spent in one area. Its
      recommended to start out with 10 questions and move to 20 as your child
      gets used to it. This area will be replaced with a form that allows you to
      record your childs correct answers and will display your clothing quiz
      score after submitted. There is no limit to how many progress reports can
      be recorded, just be sure to fill them out correctly to help you identify
      where your child may need work. You can navigate back to this reports page
      by clicking the top left hand side log, however doing so before saving a
      report will clear all of your scores & comments.
